# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Arrays Lists Stacks Queues Dequeues 

* First package consists of some popular tasks on Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Dequeues and their implementation.

## Sorting algorithms

* Second package is about sorting algorithms. This I personally find the most interesting one.

## Graphs

* In this package I tried to illustrate how to use Kruskal algorithm. (It's a pity that I cannot find other graph algorithms, they are also cool)

## Maps

* Fourth package is about maps and sets. Relatively easy, but useful.

## Search Trees

* Fifth package is one of the hardest, especially because here are use fancy tree, such as RedBlackTrees.
These are search trees (fancy), as far as I know, they are mostly used when you need to store a lot of data on disk, 
ask Google or any company which produces HDD or SSD. Read more on other websites. 
* Algorithms here are mostly about checking some properties of such trees, but not about constructing.

## Simple Trees, Iterators, Heaps

* Sixth package is also useful. At least just to know about such things as iterators or heaps is useful. 

## General recommendation

I recommend reading this code and try to implement some algorithms. In case you can find a solution, that is better than mine,
feel free to contact me.
